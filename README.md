# PMD-RTDX-Cutsceneless-Hack
A Hack of Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX that removes cutscenes while keeping gameplay as intact as possible.

Thus far, the Any% portion is finished.

---
This hack has been made by editing the Lua scripts that the game uses to control cutscenes. Both the repo and the releases section essentially contain the same files, as the scripts are not compiled unlike the 3DS games.
